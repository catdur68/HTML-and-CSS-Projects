	<p>Initially, this section was a division. But the CSS code referring to the paragraph will not break through the barrier of the division.</p> 
	<p>I had to removed the 'div' code to get the CSS code to work on this paragraph.</p> 
	</p>
	
	<h2><u>'h2 headline'</u></h2>
		<p>This headline and paragraph are out of the above division. Here, the CSS code passes through. </p>
