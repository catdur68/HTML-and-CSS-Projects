		<h1>COVID-19: The NE at risk of back-sliding.<br> States currently with <span style = "color: red; font-weight: Bold; font-style: italic">RED FLAGS</span>: Florida, Arizona, Texas, California</br></h1>
			<p>
				"Efforts to contain the coronavirus in the United States continue<br>
				to have varying degrees of success on a timeline that changes depending on the region of the country.<br>
				In July, the epicenters of the virus shifted from New York and surrounding states<br>
				to places in the south and west like Florida, Arizona, Texas, and California.<br>
				But as officials in some of those states—Arizona, for example—took <em>action to retighten</br>
				restrictions</em> that had eased during reopening, case numbers have begun to flatten.</br>
				And now, according to Ashish Jha, MD, K.T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</br>
				and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute (HGHI), concern has shifted back</br>
				to states at risk in the northeast—where previous success has lead to overly lax behavior in recent weeks."
